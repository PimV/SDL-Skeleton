SDL-Skeleton
============

To use this skeleton, carefully follow these 5 steps:

1. Clone this branch for the X86-version of SDL
2. Once cloned, open it up in Visual Studio
3. Go to "Project->Properties->Configuration Properties->VC++ Directories"
4. Add a new Include Directory and set the path to your local "SDL\include" path (ex: C:\SDL\include)
5. Add a new Library Directory and set the path to your local "SDL\lib\x86" path (ex: C:\SDL\lib\x86)

If all is well, it should work now.
